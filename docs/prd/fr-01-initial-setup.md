## User Story

As a developer, I want to view HTML presentations generated by Claude Code so that I can navigate them without browser tab chaos.

## Problem

Claude Code generates HTML artifacts in folders. Managing these via browser tabs is chaotic. Need a dedicated viewer that discovers and displays them.

## Solution

FliDeck - a local-first presentation harness that:
- Discovers presentations from a configured root folder
- Displays list of available presentations
- Renders HTML assets with their own styles
- Watches for file changes and auto-refreshes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] App discovers presentations from configured root folder
- [x] App displays list of available presentations
- [x] User can select a presentation and see its assets
- [x] User can switch between assets
- [x] Assets render correctly with their own styles
- [x] File changes trigger UI refresh
- [x] Basic navigation (back, forward, home) works

## Technical Notes
